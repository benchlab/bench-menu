# Bench Web Navigation Component

Module for Bench's navigation across all Bench-based websites.

## Usage

Simply use bower to install this component and then link the CSS and the JS files into the head of your site.

1. Installing via bower
```bash
bower install bench-menu --save
```

2. Add link to the JS and CSS files in your sites header
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="/bower-components/bench-menu/build/css/cookie-policy.css" />
<script src="/bower-components/bench-menu/build/js/global.js"></script>
<script>bench.globalNav.setup();</script>
```

The Bench menu component should now appear across the top of the website.

Note: You can specify the directory in which you want your bower components installed in a `.bowerrc`. For example:
```json
{
  "directory": "static/components/"
}
```
